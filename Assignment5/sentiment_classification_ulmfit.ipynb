good movie , good music , good background and an acceptable plot . but the main point again as his movies tend to be , the man is the best actor in xxunk and can turn dust into gold . xxunk xxunk . this may be his second best performance after xxunk ( others may disagree ) . although other movies are not far behind . one man that will never ever disappoint you . \n"," \n","  good movie although i think xxunk was a luxury this movie could have done without . you can see in his movies , others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins . but this man is really something xxunk . \n"," \n","  the movie is cool , the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good . a must watch .,xxbos xxmaj this is the first xxmaj american film to successfully xxunk the xxunk style used by xxmaj europeans , particularly the xxmaj french and xxmaj xxunk , for at least a decade , and is n't it about time ? xxmaj following three high school girls in the xxmaj crown xxmaj heights neighborhood of xxmaj brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years , it does what all good art should : it discovers the universal in the particular . xxmaj even though the girls ' xxunk are xxunk conventional -- boys , sex , popularity , money , freedom , and clothes -- we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped , the universal xxunk between character and destiny . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the naturalism is whole , complete . xxmaj the film xxunk , stays in the moment , inhabits real time . xxmaj the story tells itself . xxmaj the medium and its artifacts , for once , are not the message . xxmaj the film xxunk , truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters ; it does not xxunk its own adult meanings or morals . xxmaj details emerge of their own , are never pushed , and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement . xxmaj even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of xxmaj crown xxmaj heights , part of the largest xxmaj black ghetto in xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj city and one of the most dangerous violent places in the xxup us , the subject is childhood in the ghetto , not the ghetto itself . \n"," \n","  xxmaj documentary footage of the practice xxunk of a marching band , the xxmaj jackie xxmaj robinson xxmaj steppers , xxunk the film at regular xxunk with an explosion of color , movement , and sound . xxmaj otherwise , the camera stays very close , very intimate , a patient , xxunk , and xxunk observer . xxmaj the language is rich , xxunk , the acting transparent . xxmaj some scenes standout , such as the girls xxunk about , each revealing her deepest fantasies . xxmaj lanisha 's confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking , one of the deepest xxunk of the ghetto . xxmaj her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving , and beautifully , xxunk xxunk . \n"," \n","  xxmaj social realities are respected , not xxunk : xxmaj all three girls are being raised by single moms , only one , xxmaj lanisha , has a father active in her life ( and , not xxunk , of the three she is the most emotionally stable and xxunk to others , and the one with the most self - respect ) . xxmaj two of them suffer from xxunk , a disease xxunk prevalent in the inner city . xxmaj gunfire , an accepted daily occurrence , only xxunk xxunk their conversation . xxmaj only one of the girls , xxmaj joy , feels hope for , feels she has control over the future , while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair . \n"," \n","  xxmaj this is by far the best dramatic xxmaj american film i 've seen in years . xxmaj see it , see it , see it .,xxbos i saw this film on the xxmaj history xxmaj channel today ( in 2006 ) . xxmaj first of all , i realize that this is not a documentary -- that it is a drama . xxmaj but , one might hope that at least the critical \" facts \" that the story turns on might be based on actual events . xxmaj reagan was shot and the other characters were real people . xxmaj the movie got that right . xxmaj from there on , xxunk on facts rapidly xxunk . i had never heard of this movie before seeing it . xxmaj having been a xxup tv reporter at the time of these events , i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of xxmaj secretary xxmaj haig as portrayed by xxmaj richard xxmaj dreyfuss . xxmaj the whole nation had heard the \" i am in control ... \" , etc . , but xxmaj xxunk ' xxmaj haig is bullying a xxunk xxunk and totally out of control personally . xxmaj having watched the film , i began xxunk the subject on the xxmaj internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and xxunk of most of the xxmaj situation xxmaj room conversations that this film pretends to xxunk . xxmaj incredibly , many the the principal \" facts \" of the film meant to show a xxmaj white xxmaj house , xxmaj secret xxmaj service etc . in total chaos -- and the nation 's leadership behaving xxunk and driving the world near the xxunk of nuclear war -- are xxunk incorrect . xxmaj they did n't happen ! xxmaj there is internal conflict , to be sure . xxmaj haig makes xxunk , his press room performance is historically xxunk and he is \" difficult \" . xxmaj but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film . xxmaj there are too many gross errors to list , but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish . xxmaj xxunk ? xxmaj inform ? xxmaj entertain ? i believe they failed on all three xxunk . xxmaj it is difficult to ascribe motives to others , but one must seriously question what was behind such xxunk xxunk . xxmaj and , as for my beloved xxmaj history xxmaj channel 's \" xxmaj reel to xxmaj real \" follow - on documentary , there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film -- namely the events within the xxmaj xxunk on the day of the shooting . xxmaj so , the viewer was left to research those without much -- if any -- help from the network .,xxbos xxmaj the first \" side - story \" in the universal century xxmaj gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies . xxmaj the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict , but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the story does contain some xxmaj gundam staples , its premise being the attempts by a xxup zeon squad to capture an experimental xxmaj gundam , but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch . xxmaj this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named xxmaj alfred and the relationship between his neighbor , xxmaj christina xxmaj xxunk who is secretly a xxmaj xxunk pilot and a xxunk xxmaj zeon pilot named xxmaj bernie xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj alfred develops a sort of \" xxunk love \" for xxmaj bernie while our young xxmaj zeon pilot also falls for xxmaj christina . \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj war in the xxmaj pocket \" proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story . xxmaj there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here . xxmaj this short 6 episode xxup ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are . xxmaj alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool . xxmaj he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war . xxmaj the unlikely friendship and bonding between xxmaj bernie and xxmaj christina , each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war , is played very real without going xxunk with the romance drama stuff . xxmaj same goes for the endearing relationship between xxmaj alfred and xxmaj bernie . xxmaj that being said , i would not want to spoil much of the story here , but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending . \n"," \n","  xxmaj despite its lack of action , this show never falls into the category of \" boring \" . xxmaj the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show . xxmaj not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there . xxmaj each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an xxup ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some \" mandatory \" mobile suit battles in a xxmaj gundam series . \n"," \n","  xxmaj normally watching anime in xxmaj japanese or xxmaj english , i would leave up to personal preference . xxmaj but in this case , i strongly recommend the xxmaj english voice track over the xxmaj japanese one . xxmaj not only do the characters , whom all except xxmaj alfred are caucasian , sound more believable in xxmaj english but the performances of the xxmaj english voice cast are on par and even xxunk the xxmaj japanese one , instilling each character with such realistic emotions and xxunk that they sound just the acting in some live action xxup tv dramas . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in short , this show does not try to impress the audience . xxmaj what it does is conveys numerous xxunk themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child . a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given .,xxbos xxmaj this movie was so bad that my xxunk . went down about 40 points after seeing it . xxmaj it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it . xxmaj it must of been some kind of personal favor to xxmaj van xxmaj damme .\n","y: LMLabelList\n",",,,,\n","Path:

xxup and subjects ! xxmaj brooks xxunk wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to xxunk . xxmaj although he films on actual locations , he keeps his distance . xxmaj the murderers are portrayed as xxunk imbeciles , which surely they were . xxmaj they 're not seen as xxunk souls ( as in the xxmaj capote book ) and the xxunk of their act is xxunk blunt . xxmaj scott xxmaj wilson and xxmaj robert xxmaj blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast , including xxmaj john xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj paul xxmaj stewart as the reporter ( the xxmaj capote \" character ? \" ) xxmaj the landmark photography is by the great xxmaj conrad xxmaj hall .,xxbos i 'm stunned that the reviewers xxunk imdb gave this xxup tv film as a high a rating as they did . xxmaj it 's an xxunk , sweet , xxunk cliché ' of a film that had two big names from the past in it ( both of whom did a decent job ) , but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels . i like a good romance as well as anyone , but as my wife and i were watching this -- and before we saw the rating - we said , \" xxmaj there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there 's nothing in it to challenge their brains , their faith , their comfort level or their cultural preferences . xxmaj it 's possible to make a good film like that ( and

holiday films . xxmaj watch xxmaj the xxmaj family xxmaj stone . xxmaj it 's miles ahead of this schlock .,xxbos xxmaj excellent view of a mature woman , that is going to lose everything ( even the xxunk has a xxunk ) . xxmaj the way she gets involved into this special \" business \" , the innocence , and the true love that exists between the people of a little town , it 's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh , light and funny comedy . i could n't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a xxunk . \n"," \n","  i love xxmaj european films , and with movies like this one , my opinion grows stronger . a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed , in this same genre , is xxmaj xxunk xxmaj ned xxmaj devine . \n"," \n","  xxmaj saving xxmaj grace , a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself . xxmaj you will love it .,xxbos i do n't know why i 'm commenting this stupid reality - show i happened to watch a few episodes xxunk cable xxunk broadcast

she feels like it , no matter if it is in someone 's face or into the shower as xxmaj xxunk is standing in there . xxmaj she 's xxunk about her sex - life without leaving anything to your imagination , i do n't care for my part , but i ca n't help wondering how she feels about it now when she 's divorced . xxmaj and yes , for her sake i 'm embarrassed . xxmaj but i should n't be . xxmaj she seem to live a pretty empty , shallow life though . i do n't want to xxunk lives with her even if i could . xxmaj road - kill xxup tv if you like .,xxbos xxmaj this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen . xxmaj here are the things that immediately jump out at me : 1 . xxmaj the woods were more like hills in xxmaj los xxmaj angeles with a couple trees and xxunk . xxmaj not scary whatsoever . xxmaj news flash , if you are filming in the xxmaj southern xxmaj california area , big bear is only an hour away . xxmaj they actually have trees there . \n"," \n","  2 . xxmaj the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced . xxmaj every possible line in the movie was xxunk , cliché , or just plain stupid . xxmaj for instance the name of the camp is \" camp blood \" ( lame ) , the name of the clown is \" the killer clown \" ( lame ) . xxmaj what is a clown doing in a forest anyway ? xxmaj was that the only mask they could find ? 3 . xxmaj the last but certainly the least was the acting . xxmaj absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled . a virtual xxunk of xxunk lines and poor acting . xxmaj worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph . xxmaj it 's a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy , but she was xxup not . xxmaj also , and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me , was this tool who is supposed to be \" athletic . \" xxmaj for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing xxunk with them . xxmaj then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very \" girl like \" run , that he is quite far from athletic . xxmaj oh and to the girl who played xxmaj xxunk , good xxmaj lord stop singing . xxmaj that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself . \n"," \n","  xxmaj if for some reason you do see this movie , i would at least recommend watching the special features . xxmaj the group of xxunk who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story . xxmaj in fact one of the

star , xxmaj mr. xxmaj julia , played his role equally as perfect . xxmaj it was interesting to see how reluctant xxmaj richard xxmaj dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will . xxmaj but he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed . xxmaj since everything happens for a reason in life , i believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did . i 'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in xxmaj xxunk . i think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did . \n"," \n","  xxmaj but xxrep 11 . anyways xxrep 11 . this is why i gave this film a 7 out of 10 .,xxbos xxmaj well , because i 'm a musician i thought , maybe i 'll check this movie out on xxup xxunk , nothing else good on . xxmaj one of the worst mistakes of my life so far , and it 's only half done . i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting , crappy filming and crappy effects . xxmaj but nope , i do n't even get the pleasure of that . xxmaj even the \" musicians \" were n't very good . i was hoping for maybe some laughs , but i was n't sure if they were attempting to throw in one -

brainer in the summer heat , and the cover looked cool . \n"," \n","  xxmaj of course i should 've known better . xxmaj this is a really , really bad movie . xxmaj and it gets xxunk when the makers know it 's bad , and try cover it up by adding some sexy / beautiful women , and some sex - scenes to it . xxmaj well , folks ... it xxunk cut it , does it ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj if you xxup would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very , very good , well - played and funny : go rent xxmaj lake xxmaj xxunk ! ( that is an order ),xxbos xxmaj possible spoilers re : late - appearing cameos \n"," \n","  xxmaj seldom does one see so many fine & memorable character actors ( almost entirely actresses to be precise ) in one film . xxmaj even though a few only appear for cameos , each one is a gem . xxmaj the xxmaj british do this mix of comedy and real - life pathos better than anyone xxup xxunk , so it is no surprise that most of the actors are xxmaj xxunk . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the music is great ; no doubt much had to be dubbed ( does xxmaj leslie xxmaj xxunk * really * play the xxunk so well ? maybe - who knew ? ) xxmaj but xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk was xxunk herself - her warm xxunk sound still turns my xxunk like few other jazz xxunk . \n"," \n","  xxmaj as an aging musician myself , not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course , it was a xxunk film as well -- a great film for anyone whose wondering if they 're past it in their xxunk or xxunk whatever it may be . xxmaj and of course a great celebration of the life of the stage . \n"," \n","  i missed a little of the opening , but a xxunk 9 / 10 -- and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing .,xxbos i thought that xxmaj mr. xxmaj dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator . xxmaj his co - star , xxmaj mr. xxmaj julia , played his role equally as perfect . xxmaj it was interesting to see how reluctant xxmaj richard xxmaj dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will . xxmaj but he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed . xxmaj since everything happens for a reason in life , i believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did . i 'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in xxmaj xxunk . i think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did . \n"," \n","  xxmaj but xxrep 11 . anyways xxrep 11 . this is why i gave this film a 7 out of 10 .,xxbos xxmaj well , because i 'm a musician i thought , maybe i 'll check this movie out on xxup xxunk , nothing else good on . xxmaj one of the worst mistakes of my life so far , and it 's only half done . i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting , crappy filming and crappy effects . xxmaj but nope , i do n't even get the pleasure of that . xxmaj even the \" musicians \" were n't very good . i was hoping for maybe some laughs , but i was n't sure if they were attempting to throw in one - liners or not . xxmaj but now i have to sit here and watch the rest just until xxmaj pulp xxmaj fiction starts . xxmaj or maybe something better . xxmaj and now i get to sit here xxunk until i have 10 lines\n","y: CategoryList\n","negative,negative,positive,positive,negative\n","Path:
